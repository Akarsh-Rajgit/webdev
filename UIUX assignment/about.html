  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    I'm Akarsh Raj M Hulihalli, a tech enthusiast and aspiring developer based in Bangalore, India.
    I have a strong interest in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and full-stack development.<br/>
    <br/>
    I'm currently pursuing my engineering degree and love working on projects that blend creativity with code.
    My focus is on building real-world solutions using tools like Python, C++, React, and MySQL.<br/>
    <br/>
    When I'm not coding, I enjoy learning new technologies, designing digital experiences, and writing technical content.
    This blog is my way of sharing that knowledge and connecting with like-minded people.<br/>
    I'm always open to collaboration and new learning opportunities!
